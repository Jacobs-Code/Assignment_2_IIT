I have learnt coding languages including;  <ul> <li> JavaScript (HTML, CSS)</li> <li> Python </li> <li> SQL (PHP)</li> <li> C* ( C++)</li> <li> R (RStudio data analysis)</li></ul> I have learnt the best way to learn new skills is through practice. This can be seen through my previous work which you can see here: <a style = 'color: white' href='portfolio.html'>Portfolio</a>", "Images/web-developer.png"],
    ["Engineering", "I often apply my coding knowledge in real word situations. The prime example of this is an automatic aquarium with a mechanical 3D printed system controlled by a motor. Through my exploration of engineering I have gained skills in <ul><li>3D Printing</li><li>Electrical Engineering</li><li>3D Modelling</li><li>And more</li></ul>", "Images/settings.png"],
    ["Exercise", "Maintaining my physical health is essential to consistency. For many years I participated in the team sport of football earning many awards. Through this endeavour I learnt the importance of clear communication both within a team environment and between individuals, developing the resilience to always get up when knocked down. When stuck, I value being brave and asking my team for help, as I know a team can overcome hurdles that are too high for one to jump alone. Complementary to participating in football, I often run becoming a part of a community, I volunteer at a weekly running event called 'Park Run' a 5 Kilometre run.", "Images/running-shoe.png"],
    ["Music", "I have played clarinet and saxophone since I was 9 years old, participating in multiple bands. Through my music, I have achieved Eisteddfod awards for musical performance. During my time learning these instruments I have gained experience in habits and learning as a skill. Playing instruments, like most skills, requires the ability attempt something the knowledge that you donâ€™t know everything. It is easy to learn unwanted habits and shortcuts to make up for shortcomings. I have developed techniques to break out of unwanted habits through dedication and practice with the knowledge that I am able to do so with time.", "Images/saxophone.png"]
